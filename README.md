# Quora-insincere-sincere-questions-Classification

In this project, i performed a text analysis based on data that was given from Kaggle. I followed the Bag-of- Words (BoW), TF-IDF, N-gram, and Naive Bayes approach to develop a model that classifies Quora questions as sincere or insincere, in order to compare their metrics (Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, and
F1-score).
